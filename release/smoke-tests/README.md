# Smoke Tests

This directory contains smoke tests for Data Prepper. Data Prepper smoke tests perform very basic validation of artifacts to ensure that they were
built correctly. The unit, integration, and end-to-end tests cover for correct functionality.

## Running smoke tests on a Docker Image

To run automated smoke test on an image you can use the following command

```shell
./release/smoke-tests/run-smoke-tests.sh -v <image_tag> -r <image_repository>
```

To run smoke tests on the latest published docker image you would run the following command:

```shell
./release/smoke-tests/run-smoke-tests.sh -v latest -r opensearchproject
```

It is also possible to run smoke tests on a locally built image. Here is an example of targeting a local image `customImageName:myTag`. The image name (-i) is optional, the default value is `opensearch-data-prepper`.
```shell
./release/smoke-tests/run-smoke-tests.sh -v myTag -i customImageName
```

If all smoke tests complete successfully the last message printed will be "All smoke tests passed". Failing tests will result in a non-zero exit code.

## Running smoke tests on tarball files

The `run-tarball-files-smoke-tests.sh` script will smoke test a given tar archive against Docker image. Internally it uses the `run-smoke-tests.sh` script.

To run automated smoke test on the default archive file you can use the following command:

```shell
./release/smoke-tests/run-tarball-files-smoke-tests.sh
```

You can also customize what it tests against. The `-i` parameter specifies a base Docker image. The `-t` parameter determines which tar archive file to use.
The values for `-t` are `opensearch-data-prepper` or `opensearch-data-prepper-jdk`.

```shell
./release/smoke-tests/run-tarball-files-smoke-tests.sh -i openjdk:11 -t opensearch-data-prepper
./release/smoke-tests/run-tarball-files-smoke-tests.sh -i openjdk:17 -t opensearch-data-prepper
./release/smoke-tests/run-tarball-files-smoke-tests.sh -i ubuntu:latest -t opensearch-data-prepper-jdk
```

## Troubleshooting smoke tests

If the script is stuck repeating the message "Waiting for Data Prepper to start" try the following steps

### 1. Confirm all containers are running with `docker ps`. Your output should be similar to the following:
```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                   COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS                          PORTS                                                                     NAMES

```
### 2. Check the container logs, these commands should be executed from ./release/smoke-test.
Tail all container logs:
```
docker-compose logs -f
```

Follow specific container logs:
```
docker-compose logs -f data-prepper
```

The Data Prepper container should show events being processed:
```
...
data-prepper_1         | 2021-12-03T19:57:30,488 [service-map-pipeline-prepper-worker-3-thread-1] INFO  org.opensearch.dataprepper.pipeline.ProcessWorker -  service-map-pipeline Worker: No records received from buffer
data-prepper_1         | 2021-12-03T19:57:31,925 [grok-pipeline-prepper-worker-7-thread-1] INFO  org.opensearch.dataprepper.pipeline.ProcessWorker -  grok-pipeline Worker: Processing 8 records from buffer
...
```
### 3. Confirm Open Search is running
```
curl -s -k -u 'admin:admin' 'https://localhost:9200/_cat/indices'
```
If indicies are displayed Open Search is running.
```

```
**To confirm if Open Search is receiving log data run**
Use the following cURL command to query the index `test-grok-index` for any documents. **Note**: The results may not show all documents received.
```
curl -k -u 'admin:admin' https://localhost:9200/test-grok-index/_search
```
If in your results the JSON path `.hits.total.value` has a value of 0 Open Search is not receiving log data. Confirm with the Data Prepper logs records are being processed from the buffer and no error messages are displayed.

**To confirm if Open Search is receiving trace data run**
Use the following cURL command to query the `otel-v1-apm-span-000001` index for documents containing **PythonService**. These documents will be generated by the **otel-span-exporter**, sent to **otel-collector**, then sent to **data-prepper**, then sent to **opensearch**.
```
curl -k -u 'admin:admin' https://localhost:9200/otel-v1-apm-span-000001/_search?q=PythonService
```
If in your results the JSON path `.hits.total.value` has a value of 0 Open Search is not receiving trace data. Confirm OTel opentelemetry-collector logs are continueally displaying metrics and no errors are printing. Next confirm with the Data Prepper logs records are being processed from the buffer and no error messages are displayed.

### 4. Manually send data to Data Prepper
The following cURL command will send a JSON formatted HTTP log to Data Prepper:
```
curl -k \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "[{\"log\": \"smoke test log\"}]" \
    "http://localhost:2021/log/ingest"
```

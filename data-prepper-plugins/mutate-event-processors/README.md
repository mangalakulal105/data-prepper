# Mutate Event Processors
The following is a list of processors available to mutate an event.

___

##AddEntryProcessor
A processor that adds entries to an event

###Basic Usage
To get started, create the following `pipeline.yaml`.
```yaml
pipeline:
  source:
    file:
      path: "/full/path/to/logs_json.log"
      record_type: "event"
      format: "json"
  processor:
    - add_entries:
        entries:
        - key: "newMessage"
          value: 3
          overwrite_if_key_exists: true
  sink:
    - stdout:
```

Create the following file named `logs_json.log` and replace the `path` in the file source of your `pipeline.yaml` with the path of this file.

```json
{"message": "value"}
```

When run, the processor will parse the message into the following output:

```json
{"message": "value", "newMessage": 3}
```

> If `newMessage` had already existed, its existing value would have been overwritten with `3`

###Configuration
* `entries` - (required) - A list of entries to add to an event
  * `key` - (required) - The key of the new entry to be added
  * `value` - (required) - The value of the new entry to be added. Strings, booleans, numbers, null, nested objects, and arrays containing the aforementioned data types are valid to use
  * `overwrite_if_key_exists` - (optional) - When set to `true`, if `key` already exists in the event, then the existing value will be overwritten. The default is `false`.

##CopyValueProcessor
A processor that copies values within an event

###Basic Usage
To get started, create the following `pipeline.yaml`.
```yaml
pipeline:
  source:
    file:
      path: "/full/path/to/logs_json.log"
      record_type: "event"
      format: "json"
  processor:
    - copy_values:
        entries:
        - from_key: "message"
          to_key: "newMessage"
          overwrite_if_to_key_exists: true
  sink:
    - stdout:
```

Create the following file named `logs_json.log` and replace the `path` in the file source of your `pipeline.yaml` with the path of this file.

```json
{"message": "value"}
```

When run, the processor will parse the message into the following output:

```json
{"message": "value", "newMessage": "value"}
```

> If `newMessage` had already existed, its existing value would have been overwritten with `value`

###Configuration
* `entries` - (required) - A list of entries to be copied in an event
    * `from_key` - (required) - The key of the entry to be copied
    * `to_key` - (required) - The key of the new entry to be added
    * `overwrite_if_to_key_exists` - (optional) - When set to `true`, if `to_key` already exists in the event, then the existing value will be overwritten. The default is `false`.

___

##DeleteEntryProcessor
A processor that deletes entries in an event

###Basic Usage
To get started, create the following `pipeline.yaml`.
```yaml
pipeline:
  source:
    file:
      path: "/full/path/to/logs_json.log"
      record_type: "event"
      format: "json"
  processor:
    - delete_entries:
        with_keys: ["message"]
  sink:
    - stdout:
```

Create the following file named `logs_json.log` and replace the `path` in the file source of your `pipeline.yaml` with the path of this file.

```json
{"message": "value", "message2": "value2"}
```

When run, the processor will parse the message into the following output:

```json
{"message2": "value2"}
```

> If `message` had not existed in the event, then nothing would have happened

###Configuration
* `with_keys` - (required) - An array of keys of the entries to be deleted

___

##RenameKeyProcessor
A processor that renames keys in an event

###Basic Usage
To get started, create the following `pipeline.yaml`.
```yaml
pipeline:
  source:
    file:
      path: "/full/path/to/logs_json.log"
      record_type: "event"
      format: "json"
  processor:
    - rename_keys:
        entries:
        - from_key: "message"
          to_key: "newMessage"
          overwrite_if_to_key_exists: true
  sink:
    - stdout:
```

Create the following file named `logs_json.log` and replace the `path` in the file source of your `pipeline.yaml` with the path of this file.

```json
{"message": "value"}
```

When run, the processor will parse the message into the following output:

```json
{"newMessage": "value"}
```

> If `newMessage` had already existed, its existing value would have been overwritten with `value`

###Configuration
* `entries` - (required) - A list of entries to rename in an event
    * `from_key` - (required) - The key of the entry to be renamed
    * `to_key` - (required) - The new key of the entry
    * `overwrite_if_to_key_exists` - (optional) - When set to `true`, if `to_key` already exists in the event, then the existing value will be overwritten. The default is `false`.

###Special Consideration
The renaming operation occurs in the order defined. This means that chaining is implicit with the RenameKeyProcessor. Take the following `piplines.yaml` for example:
```yaml
pipeline:
  source:
    file:
      path: "/full/path/to/logs_json.log"
      record_type: "event"
      format: "json"
  processor:
    - rename_key:
        entries:
        - from_key: "message"
          to_key: "message2"
        - from_key: "message2"
          to_key: "message3"
  sink:
    - stdout:
```

Let the contents of `logs_json.log` be the following:
```json
{"message": "value"}
```

After the processor runs, this will be the output
```json
{"message3": "value"}
```

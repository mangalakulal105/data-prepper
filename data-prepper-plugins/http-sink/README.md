# Http Sink

This is the Data Prepper Http sink plugin that sends records to http/https endpoints. You can use the sink to send data to arbitrary HTTP Endpoints.


## Usages

The Http sink should be configured as part of Data Prepper pipeline yaml file.

### Response status

* `200`: the request data has been successfully pushed to http endpoint.
* `500`: internal server error while process the request data.
* `400`: bad request error
* `404`: the http endpoint is not reachable
* `501`: the server does not recognize the request method and is incapable of supporting it for any resource

### HTTP Basic authentication
```
pipeline:
  ...
  sink:
  - http:
      authentication:
        http_basic:
          username: my-user
          password: my_s3cr3t
```

### HTTP Bearer token authentication
```
pipeline:
  ...
  sink:
  - http:
      authentication:
         bearer_token:
            client_id: 0oaafr4j79grYGC5d7
            client_secret: fFel-3FutCXAOndezEsOVlght6D6DR4OIt7G5D1_oJ6YtgU17JdyXmGf0M
            token_url: https://localhost/oauth2/default/v1/token
            grant_type: client_credentials
            scope: httpSink
```

## Configuration

- `url` The http/https endpoint url.

- `proxy`(optional): A String of the address of a forward HTTP proxy. The format is like "<host-name-or-ip>:\<port\>". Examples: "example.com:8100", "http://example.com:8100", "112.112.112.112:8100". Note: port number cannot be omitted.

- `codec` : This plugin is integrated with sink codec

- `http_method` (Optional) : HttpMethod to be used. Default is POST.

- `auth_type` (Optional): Authentication type configuration. By default, this runs an unauthenticated server.

- `username`(optional): A string of username required for basic authentication

- `password`(optional): A string of password required for basic authentication

- `client_id`: It is the client id is the public identifier of your authorization server.

- `client_secret` : It is a secret known only to the application and the authorization server.

- `token_url`: The End point URL of the OAuth server.(Eg: /oauth2/default/v1/token)

- `grant_type` (Optional) : This grant type refers to the way an application gets an access token. Example: client_credentials/refresh_token

- `scope` (Optional) : This scope limit an application's access to a user's account.

- `aws_sigv4`: A boolean flag to sign the HTTP request with AWS credentials. Default to `false`. For aws_sigv4, we don't need any auth_type or ssl

- `aws` (Optional) : AWS configurations. See [AWS Configuration](#aws_configuration) for details. SigV4 is enabled by default when this option is used. If this option is present, `aws_` options are not expected to be present. If any of `aws_` options are present along with this, error is thrown.

- `custom_header` (Optional) : A Map<String, List<String> for custom headers such as AWS Sagemaker etc

- `dlq_file`(optional): A String of absolute file path for DLQ failed output records. Defaults to null.
  If not provided, failed records will be written into the default data-prepper log file (`logs/Data-Prepper.log`). If the `dlq` option is present along with this, an error is thrown.

- `dlq` (optional): DLQ configurations. See [DLQ](https://github.com/opensearch-project/data-prepper/tree/main/data-prepper-plugins/failures-common/src/main/java/org/opensearch/dataprepper/plugins/dlq/README.md) for details. If the `dlq_file` option is present along with this, an error is thrown.

- `buffer_type`(optional) : Buffer type can be in_memory/local_file. Default is in_memory

- `max_retries`(optional): A number indicating the maximum number of times Http Sink should try to push the data to the Http arbitrary endpoint before considering it as failure. Defaults to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.

- `request_timout`(optional): A duration that represents the request timeout. Example: 1000ms, 5s etc

### SSL

* insecure_skip_verify(Optional) => A `boolean` that enables mTLS/SSL. Default is ```false```.
  * If set to false then the user has two options:
    * Use default trust. This can allow for reaching many endpoints. The user does not need to provide any .crt/.key files.
    * Allow the user to specify a .crt file for a certificate (no .key is required because this is the client). By the user providing the .crt file, the user is stating he trusts that certificate. We will still verify the signature match.
  * If set to true, then skip any verification of the certificate. The user does not need to provide a .crt or .key file.
* insecure (Optional) => A `boolean` that allows http/https endpoints. Default is ```false```.
   * If set to false, then only https:// URLs are permitted. Throw an InvalidPluginConfigurationException if the URL is configured with an http:// scheme in the URL.
   * If set to true, then the user can provide both http:// https:// as the scheme. 
* ssl_certificate_file(Optional) => A `String` that represents the SSL certificate chain file path or AWS S3 path. S3 path example `s3://<bucketName>/<path>`. Required if `ssl` is set to `true` and `use_acm_certificate_for_ssl` is set to `false`.
* ssl_key_file(Optional) => A `String` that represents the SSL key file path or AWS S3 path. S3 path example `s3://<bucketName>/<path>`. Only decrypted key file is supported. Required if `ssl` is set to `true` and `use_acm_certificate_for_ssl` is set to `false`.
* use_acm_certificate_for_ssl(Optional) : A `boolean` that enables mTLS/SSL using certificate and private key from AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). Default is `false`.
* acm_certificate_arn(Optional) : A `String` that represents the ACM certificate ARN. ACM certificate take preference over S3 or local file system certificate. Required if `use_acm_certificate_for_ssl` is set to `true`.
* acm_private_key_password(Optional): A `String` that represents the ACM private key password which that will be used to decrypt the private key. If it's not provided, a random password will be generated.
* acm_certificate_timeout_millis(Optional) : An `int` that represents the timeout in milliseconds for ACM to get certificates. Default value is `120000`.

### <a name="aws_configuration">AWS Configuration</a>

* `region` (Optional) : The AWS region to use for credentials. Defaults to [standard SDK behavior to determine the region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/region-selection.html).
* `sts_role_arn` (Optional) : The STS role to assume for requests to AWS. Defaults to null, which will use the [standard SDK behavior for credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials.html).
* `sts_header_overrides` (Optional): A map of header overrides to make when assuming the IAM role for the sink plugin.
* `sts_external_id` (Optional): An optional external ID to use when assuming an IAM role.
* `service_name` The AWS service name to who endpoint we are connecting to. Default: execute-api, Example: lambda, apigateway
### Threshold
* event_count => The event_count size should be between 0 and 10000000
* maximum_size => The size of byte capacity, Default is 50mb
* event_collect_timeout => The event_collect timeout is between 1 and 3600 seconds

## Metrics

### Counter

- `httpSinkRecordsSuccessCounter`: measures total number of records successfully pushed to http end points (200 response status code) by HTTP sink plugin.
- `httpSinkRecordsFailedCounter`: measures total number of records failed to pushed to http end points (500/400/404/501 response status code) by HTTP sink plugin.

### End-to-End acknowledgements

If the events received by the Http Sink have end-to-end acknowledgements enabled (which is tracked using the presence of EventHandle in the event received for processing), then upon successful posting to OpenSearch or upon successful write to DLQ, a positive acknowledgement is sent to the acknowledgementSetManager, otherwise a negative acknowledgement is sent.

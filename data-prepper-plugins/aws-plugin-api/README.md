# AWS Plugin API

This provides an API for plugins which wish to use the AWS Plugin for Data Prepper.

## Using

Add the following project:

```
implementation project(':data-prepper-plugins:aws-plugin-api')
```

This project does not yet deploy to Maven, so you cannot use it for external plugin development at the time.

# Log HTTP Source

This is a source plugin that supports HTTP protocol. Currently ONLY support Json UTF-8 codec for incoming request, e.g. 
`[{"key1": "value1"}, {"key2": "value2"}]`.


## Usages
Currently, we are exposing `/log/ingest` URI path for http log ingestion. Example `.yaml` configuration:
```
source:
    - http:
```

### Response status

* `200`: the request data has been successfully written into the buffer.
* `400`: the request data is either in mal-format or unsupported codec.
* `413`: the request data size is larger than the configured capacity.
* `415`: the request fails to be written into the buffer within the timeout.
* `429`: the request has been rejected due to the HTTP source executor being in full capacity.

## Configurations

* port(Optional) => An `int` between 0 and 65535 represents the port source is running on. Default is ```2021```.
* request_timeout(Optional) => An `int` larger than 0 represents request timeout in millis. Default is ```10_000```. 
* thread_count(Optional) => An `int` larger than 0 represents the number of threads to keep in the ScheduledThreadPool. Default is `200`.
* max_connection_count(Optional) => An `int` larger than 0 represents the maximum allowed number of open connections. Default is `500`.
* max_pending_requests(Optional) => An `int` larger than 0 represents the maximum allowed number of tasks in the ScheduledThreadPool work queue. Default is `1024`.

### SSL

* ssl(Optional) => A `boolean` enables TLS/SSL. Default is ```true```.
* ssl_certificate_file(Optional) => A `String` represents the SSL certificate chain file path. Required if ```ssl``` is set to ```true```.
* ssl_key_file(Optional) => A `String` represents the SSL key file path. Only decrypted key file is supported. Required if ```ssl``` is set to ```true```.

## Metrics

### Counter
- `requestsReceived`: measures total number of requests received by `/log/ingest` endpoint.
- `requestsRejected`: measures total number of requests rejected (429 response status code) by HTTP source plugin.
- `successRequests`: measures total number of requests successfully processed (200 response status code) by HTTP source plugin.
- `badRequests`: measures total number of requests with invalid content type or format processed by HTTP source plugin (400 response status code).
- `requestTimeouts`: measures total number of requests that time out in the HTTP source server (415 response status code).
- `requestsTooLarge`: measures total number of requests of which the events size in the content is larger than the buffer capacity (413 response status code).

### Timer
- `requestProcessDuration`: measures latency of requests processed by the HTTP source plugin in seconds. 

### Distribution Summary
- `payloadSize`: measures the distribution of incoming requests payload sizes in bytes.

# Data Prepper

We envision Data Prepper as an open source data collector for observability data (trace, logs, metrics) that can filter, enrich, transform, normalize, and aggregate data for downstream analysis and visualization. It will support stateful processing across multiple instances of data pipelines for observability use cases such as distributed tracing and multi-line log events (e.g. stack traces, aggregations, and log-to-metric transformations). Currently Data Prepper supports processing of distributed trace data and will support processing of logs and metric data in the future. 

Please read the [Overview](docs/readme/overview.md) to understand what Data Prepper is and how it works.

## Getting Started

Our [Getting Started](docs/readme/getting_started.md) guide is the best starting point for anybody
who wants to run Data Prepper.

Please read the [Trace Analytics](docs/readme/trace_analytics.md) guide to get started with using
Data Prepper for trace analytics use cases.
